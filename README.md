# About CV-on-react
Generates CV from json file. Build using npx-create-react.  
url: https://cv-on-react.azurewebsites.net/

In the project I've used external libraries and sources:  
https://github.com/cognitom/paper-css to make it A4  
https://www.storyblok.com/tp/react-dynamic-component-from-json to load components from json file tree

CI-CD cycle: project is deployed in Azure when pushing to github repo.
